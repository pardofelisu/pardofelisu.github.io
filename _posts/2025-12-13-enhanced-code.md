This is the enhanced CS330 artifact, which I added 3 enhancements in 3 categories:

* software design and engineering
* algorithms and data structures
* databases

## Software design and Engineering

This artifact is from the CS330 final project, which showcases a 3D scene of a bedroom. It now shows multiple rooms alongside different items that will be interactable by the player, as well as a final “boss” entity. This was created in March of this year, and further iterated on today, November 16, 2025.
I selected this artifact because of its complexity in different dimensions, both 2D and 3D. This artifact showcases my ability to manipulate different objects in 2- and 3-dimensional space, as well as my ability to refractor the scene and implement various features.
I have met the course outcomes I have planned, though I would like to update the textures and have different materials used to differentiate the objects from one another. This will occur when finalizing the algorithm enhancement, as this would include the usage of different coding languages to potentially host the textures.
From updating this artifact, I have learned that I need to be more creative in designing 3D scenes. Despite this, I believe that the final submission after everything is enhanced will showcase and portray what I have in mind for this 3D scene. One challenge that I faced during this enhancement is the mismatch of operating systems, as the artifact was created for and on Windows- I am currently working on MacOS. If possible, I want to implement widespread compatibility for different OS’, eliminating the need to have a virtual machine to run certain code.

## Algorithms and data structures

This artifact is the continued enhancement of my CS330 final project, which is now a 3D scene with multiple rooms and objects to interact with. I selected this item to showcase my ability to handle multiple dependencies that a user might have, such as OpenGL and GLEW downloads. With my inclusion of the AllInOne.py file, I have created a way to ensure the initialization of these dependencies, as well as downloading what is needed. I also added a way to see if there was an error in running or installing the programs through a Try Except block. I believe that though this seems like a small change in the overall big picture of the project, it eliminates having to search for which programs the user needs to download- it’s all in the AllInOne! As I created this enhancement, I used my learnings from my job as a software engineer at my job. The common complaint is that users don’t know what they need to download and don’t know how to download it. Thus, this enhancement came to fruition. The one challenge I faced when completing this enhancement is the python language itself, where I haven’t utilized it in a while. This means that I had to look up some guides on the python namespace, which refreshed my memory on how python works.

## Databases

This artifact is the continued enhancement of the CS330 final project, which depicts a 3D scene with multiple rooms, interactable objects, and now a database that handles the objects and if they were interacted with. I selected this item to iterate on its expandability through database functions, which is one of the many skills I was able to learn in my prior Full-Stack course. This addition of a database improves on how the player will play the game, where there is an objective of finding all objects and interacting with them throughout their journey through the 3D space. With this enhancement, I have fulfilled my planned objective, and created the ability to add different objects, either in the database itself or through the addItem function itself. From this enhancement, I’ve learned to leverage my prior knowledge on database creation as well as utilize certain database CRUD functions.
