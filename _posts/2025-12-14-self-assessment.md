Since January 2023, I have been working diligently towards my Bachelor of computer 
science with a concentration in Software Engineering, working towards becoming 
proficient in programming and security. This capstone course is to highlight my 
skills across multiple disciplines, such as collaboration, communication, 
data structures and algorithms, Software Engineering and Database Engineering, 
and Security. I have selected one artifact from the CS330 course to highlight and
 share my improvements in certain areas, Software Design and Engineering, 
Algorithms and Data Structures, and finally Databases. 

Completing the coursework and developing my ePortfolio helped me display my 
strengths through pacing myself throughout the term with weekly milestones and 
journals, as well as help me develop my goals as a Computer Scientist. 
Throughout the entirety of this course, I have used a status chart that shows 
where exactly I am in the course, which is updated weekly.

This simple chart is what allowed me to visually see what I needed to do in the 
future weeks and helped me pace myself through the course. At my current job as a 
Software Engineer, my team uses a chart like the one above, an Excel spreadsheet 
that shows what each team member is doing and will do, as well as document user 
requests. Being one of many engineers at a large company means that you must write 
down exactly what is needed and when it will be done, which helps with documentation 
and communication within the team.

Apart from completing this chart, after every milestone I wrote different narratives 
on the work I completed that defended the reason for enhancing the artifact and 
what I did that aligned with the course outcomes. These narratives helped me 
understand how my enhancements highlighted my developed capabilities, such as how 
I integrated multiple fail safes into the main code (e.g., security) and created a 
database to hold user and item information. From this, the narratives exposed why 
The enhancements mattered to the bigger picture. 
To become more employable in the computer science field, I have worked on the 
following course outcomes:

*	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse 
audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
*	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual 
communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to 
specific audiences and contexts
*	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using 
algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to 
its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
*	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, 
and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions 
that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
*	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software 
architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, 
and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

These outcomes are important to my current job, where I must hold multiple code 
reviews to an audience, continuously update my team’s Excel spreadsheet, design and 
build multiple solutions to user problems, improve user experience and performance, 
and review user security issues to prevent adverse attacks on our systems. These 
skills are developing every day at my job; I am constantly gaining experience and 
receiving feedback on my work. 

To introduce the artifact that I have worked on for the entirety of this course, 
I first must explain where it came from. The artifact is from the CS330 computational 
graphics and visualization course, which uses OpenGL textures and graphics. This 
artifact is of a 3D scene of a simple bedroom that holds multiple intractable objects. 
has different lighting effects and user movement. Across three milestones, 
I have made enhancements in three categories: software design and engineering, 
algorithms and data structures, and databases. Specifically, these enhancements are: 
the addition of multiple items in the 3D space, inclusion of a file that is 
initialized on startup to check for dependencies and fix them, and the creation of 
a database that holds user information and item information. I chose to enhance 
this artifact because of its being a 3D space with multiple complexities, the different 
files used to create the 3D scene, and how the user can move around in the space.  
Before enhancing the artifact, I made an informal code review that showed exactly 
what I wanted to enhance and what problems were present in the code. This code review 
set the stage for the enhancements and helped me build a plan for making the enhancements. 

This ePortfolio reflects my enhancements, displays my continuous improvement over the course of my academic career, and gives employers key information on who I am as a person and what my values are as a computer scientist.
