My name is Tashi Anderson, and within this ePortfolio you will find
an artifact that I have chosen from a past course to continuously enhance
through three milestones.

These milestones focused on:
1. Software design and engineering
2. Algorithms and data structure
3. Databases

These milestones are held within this ePortfolio, as well as the connected
github repository [here](https://github.com/pardofelisu/pardofelisu.github.io/tree/master)
